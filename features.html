      <h1 class="headone">Features of front-end development</h1>
      <p class="paraone">Web development is a large and complex process that includes both front-end and back-end programming.</p>
      <p class="paraone">Front-end development, sometimes called the “front office” or “face” of the application, is the part that allows users to <br>interact with your site. It includes everything from interaction design to visualizations and user interfaces so people can<br> checkout or easily find the information they need. Frontend development is the first part of a large complex of works that<br> is devoted to the development of the program interface and its interactive part.</p>
      <p class="paraone">The back end of a web application or site is the configuration of the application server, debugging client-server communication,<br> etc. The backend of a web application or the back end is where we set up the application server configurations, log cookies <br>from clients to servers, etc., but most importantly, this is where we debug the communication between client and server.</p>
      <img class="one" src="../images/web3.jpeg" alt="web1" width="900px" height="500px" />
      <p class="paraone">Returning to our main theme, the frontend has a lot of internal branching into task categories. Let’s consider some of them.</p>

      <h1 class="headtwo">UI/UX design</h1>
      <p class="paraone">A UI/UX designer makes sure that a digital product or service provides an intuitive and easy-to-use interface and positively<br> impacts the user experience. This includes ensuring that all aspects of your design are clear and thoughtful in terms of<br> functionality as well as aesthetic appeal both in terms of color schemes and how they are visually organized from each other,<br> such as tabs on different screens, which can help users find what you are looking for faster and more conveniently.</p>
      <h1 class="headtwo">Layout</h1>
      <p class="paraone">Website layout is the careful arrangement of visual elements on web pages using HTML5 markup languages ​​and CSS <br>style sheets. Interactive elements are created using frameworks such as Angular, Node JS or others that are written based on<br> the JavaScript programming language.</p>
      <h1 class="headtwo">JavaScript programming</h1>
      <p class="paraone">JavaScript is a language that can be embedded in HTML and run automatically when you visit your favorite websites.<br> Unlike other languages ​​such as Java or C# (C Sharp), it doesn’t need to be compiled before running, as JavaScripts are<br> distributed on the web as plain text without any special preparation, which means they are quite fast and easy to use.</p>
      <img class="one" src="../images/web4.jpeg" alt="web1" width="900px" height="500px" />
      <h1 class="headtwo">Internet Marketing</h1>
      <p class="paraone">Internet marketing is in close contact with front-end development as closely as possible. it is through the visual design<br> and functionality of the site that the marketer leads the client to a purchase or a key action.</p>
      <p class="paraone">Internet marketing is one of the most important aspects of web development because any design and appearance<br> is focused on attracting customers. With websites, social media channels, and email lists, there are so many<br> opportunities for companies to increase their bottom line, and the front-end developer and marketer is all about it.</p>
      <h1 class="headtwo">SEO optimization</h1>
      <p class="paraone">SEO (Search Engine Optimization) although it is a part of marketing, however, none of the marketing tools affects <br>front-end development as SEO does.
        Search Engine Optimization is the process of designing and promoting your<br> site with the goal of bringing it to the top positions for certain keywords, resulting in more traffic.</p>
      <p class="paraone">SEO strategy can be used as an effective marketing tool as companies search for products on their own, while<br> traditional methods such as advertising or PPC campaigns are often overlooked due to the low credibility of<br> advertising in general.
        Understanding how much front-end development can be versatile and complex,<br> before development, it is necessary to clearly indicate what the final result should be. Such design is usually <br>carried out on the basis of marketing research and is determined by the company’s strategy.</p>
      <p class="paraone">At first, it can be difficult to do all this preparatory work yourself and write the final result that will fully meet<br> the goals, so it is better to contact a reliable development team for  front end development services to ensure<br> that you get the expected result.</p>
      <h1 class="headtwo">Goals for development</h1>
      <p class="paraone">The developer of the front end keeps these points in mind, utilizing available tools and techniques to reach <br>this end.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Accessibility -</b> With continuing development for mobile devices, such as smart phones and tablets,<br> designers need to ensure that their site comes up correctly in browsers on all devices. This can be <br>done by creating a responsive web design using stylesheets in CSS.</li>
        <li><b>Performance -</b> Performance goals are chiefly concerned with render time, manipulating the HTML,<br> CSS, and JavaScript to ensure that the site opens up quickly.</li>
        <li><b>Speedy Development -</b> This technology enables speedy development and saves time.</li>
      </ul>
