      <h1 class="headone">How to Become a <br>Front End Developer?</h1>
      <p class="paraone">It seems like everyone is online these days. The Internet not only facilitates interpersonal communication<br> between users (e.g., email, social media); it’s also a much relied-upon source for all kinds of information.<br> And a convenient means of paying bills and making purchases.</p>
      <p class="paraone">Every single online application has that part with which users interact. When you log onto a website, you are<br> greeted by the welcome page, the menu, site map, and other items that facilitate navigation and utility.<br> All of those items fall under the collective term of “front end.” The front end includes the user interface, which is<br> the part of the website or app designed for the consumer’s use.</p>
      <img class="one" src="../images/web7.png" alt="web7" width="800px" height="300px" />
      <p class="paraone">You can become a front end developer if you follow these simple steps :</p>
      <h1 class="headtwo">Learn CSS, JavaScript and HTML</h1>
      <p class="paraone">These coding languages are the essential building blocks for web and app development, so you need to learn<br> them. Fortunately, it’s not a very difficult undertaking. There are lots of online resources available out there<br> that can help further your education in the coding languages. For extra credit, familiarize yourself with jQuery<br> and JavaScript Frameworks.</p>
      <h1 class="headtwo">Get Informed</h1>
      <p class="paraone">That means reading articles and books about front end development. By getting an understanding of how <br>things work on a website, you can make better sense of the various coding languages. If you want to round<br> out your learning experience, check out some videos on YouTube.</p>
      <h1 class="headtwo">Practice</h1>
      <p class="paraone">Here’s where the old saying “practice makes perfect” comes into play. Start small by using your newfound<br> knowledge to build small parts of a user interface, then expand slowly. If you end up making mistakes,<br> don’t worry. Sometimes we learn more from our errors than we do from a flawless performance.</p>
      <h1 class="headtwo">Learn the Command Line</h1>
      <p class="paraone">When pursuing a profession that has anything to do with web design, it’s a good idea to get at least a<br> basic grasp of concepts like displaying files and file system navigation. On a related note, you should<br> familiarize yourself with the properties of the Shell, which is the means of accessing operating system <br>functions via a text interface.</p>
      <h1 class="headtwo">Learn Version Control</h1>
      <p class="paraone">One of the hazards of coding is having it break when you change one small thing. Even after you try<br> to rectify the problem, things are never quite the same again. That’s why a good front end developer<br> learns version control. There is an impressive selection of version control systems to choose from,<br> but if you want to go with the most popular, go with Git.</p>
      <h1 class="headtwo">Enhance Your Skills</h1>
      <p class="paraone">Check out some tutorials, tools, and open-source projects. Resources such as freeCodeCamp,<br> Codecademy, Bootstrap, Vue.js, CSS Layout, and Front-end Checklist exist to help you master the<br> skills of front end development without having to lay out any money for the opportunity. These<br> tools are easily accessible online and can be a much-needed boost to your front end development <br>education.</p>
      <h1 class="headtwo">Take a Course</h1>
      <p class="paraone">Take a front end developer course. There’s nothing like learning from experienced people in a <br>structured environment. You could do this by physically attending classes (which can be a drain on<br> your free time), or taking an online course. There are many appropriate courses out there, but later<br> on, we’ll show you an excellent and well-tested option that would perfectly fit your needs!</p>
      <h1 class="headtwo">Get an Internship</h1>
      <p class="paraone">Become a junior front end developer. Sometimes, the best way to learn new skills is to work under<br> more knowledgeable people, and that’s what a junior front end developer or an intern does.<br> Of course, the pay is less, but you need fewer qualifications. Besides, you’ll be learning from more<br> experienced people, and that’s always beneficial.</p>
      
      <h1 class="headtwo">Front-end developer roles and <br>responsibilities</h1>
      <p class="paraone">If you're wondering what a front end developer does, he must :</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Decide web page design and structure</li>
        <li>Develop features to enhance the users’ experience</li>
        <li>Striking a balance between functional and aesthetic design</li>
        <li>Make sure the web design is smartphone-capable</li>
        <li>Build reusable code for future use</li>
        <li>Make sure web pages are optimized for best speed and scalability</li>
        <li>Employ a diverse selection of markup languages to design web pages</li>
        <li>Keep the brand consist throughout the whole design</li>
      </ul> 

      <h1 class="headtwo">What’s the future of Front-end <br>developers?</h1>
      <img class="one" src="../images/web8.png" alt="web8" width="700px" height="400px" />
      <p class="paraone">Overall, the future looks bright for anyone who wants to become a front end developer. The latest<br> studies predict that by 2020, there will be a deficit of approximately 1 million developers in the<br> United States alone. The rest of the world will have it even worse, according to similar studies.<br>
        According to the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics, Web developer employment in the US is<br> projected to grow 15% from 2016 to 2026. The rate is much faster than the average for all other <br>occupations.</p>
      <p class="paraone">Although these numbers seem incredible, if you pause and consider the times, it’s not so surprising.<br> Increased Internet usage, especially in the mobile field, means a greater need for user interfaces,<br> which in turn means more front end developer jobs. Web development is a field whose potential is<br> tied closely to the Internet’s popularity, and the latter is surging with no signs of letting up. If you<br> want to go where the jobs are, then look no further.</p>
